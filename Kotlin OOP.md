## What is OOP:

1. Encapsulation (private) : Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. Access to the data is controlled through methods.
```
class BankAccount(private var balance: Double) { // private viriable of this class

    fun deposit(amount: Double) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount
        }
    }

    fun withdraw(amount: Double) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount
        }
    }

    fun getBalance(): Double {
        return balance
    }
}

fun main() {
    val account = BankAccount(1000.0)
    account.deposit(500.0)
    account.withdraw(200.0)
    println("Current Balance: $${account.getBalance()}")
}

```
Private variables of a class cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Has to use its public function to do set get modification on this variable

2. Inheritance (Reuse repeated code) : Mechanism where a new class can inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This promotes code reuse.
```
// Base class
open class Animal(val name: String) { // open -> abstract in Java
    open fun makeSound() {
        println("$name makes a sound")
    }
}

// Derived class
class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("$name barks")
    }
}

// Another derived class
class Cat(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("$name meows")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val dog = Dog("Buddy")
    val cat = Cat("Whiskers")

    dog.makeSound() // Outputs: Buddy barks
    cat.makeSound() // Outputs: Whiskers meows
}

```
One can extend the base class to override its fucntion -> for code reusability

3. Polymorphism (override overload) : Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon.

Override(Runtime polymorphism): Same parameters but used in different subclasses

Overload(Compiletime polymorphism): Same function name but different parameters


4. Abstraction (high level) : Hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows a programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.

Abstract/Interface class: different from open() class, to implement abstract class, one class has to override all fucntion inside abstract class, without needing to understand the underlying complexity.


## Instance of the Class
An instance of a class, on the other hand, represents a specific object with its own state. While you can perform dependency injection using instances, it usually requires creating and managing those instances explicitly. This approach might be less convenient compared to using companion objects, especially when you want to provide shared behavior or configuration.

```
class User(val name: String)

fun main() {
    // Creating instances of the User class
    val user1 = User("Alice")
    val user2 = User("Bob")

    println(user1.name) // Outputs: Alice
    println(user2.name) // Outputs: Bob
}

```


## Companion Object

a companion object is a singleton object that is tied to a class rather than an instance of the class. It allows you to define members (properties and methods) that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Companion objects can be used to implement factory methods or to hold constants.


**Singleton Behavior:** It provides a way to create a singleton associated with the class, which can be beneficial for managing shared resources, configurations, or utility functions.

**Factory Methods:** You can define factory methods inside a companion object to create instances of the class, which can be helpful for managing object creation logic.

**Dependency Injection:** Because a companion object can provide methods or properties that can be accessed without creating an instance, it can simplify dependency injection by allowing easy access to configurations or services.

**Testing:** Companion objects can facilitate testing by allowing you to mock or stub out certain behaviors or dependencies without needing to instantiate the class itself. You can replace the companion object's methods in tests with mock implementations.

```
class User(val name: String) {
    companion object {
        const val DEFAULT_NAME = "Guest"

        fun createWithDefaultName(): User {
            return User(DEFAULT_NAME)
        }
    }
}

fun main() {
    // Using the factory method to create an instance
    val user1 = User.createWithDefaultName()
    println(user1.name) // Outputs: Guest

    // Creating an instance directly
    val user2 = User("Alice")
    println(user2.name) // Outputs: Alice
}

```

## Object Expression - anonymous class -> you dont have to create class to implement interface
In Kotlin, an object expression is a powerful feature that allows you to create **anonymous** objects, which can be particularly useful for **implementing interfaces** or **creating simple classes without having to formally define them**. This is similar to Java's anonymous classes but is often more concise and expressive in Kotlin.

- when you want to implement an interface, you typically would create a class that provides the implementation for the interface's methods. However, with object expressions, you can directly create an instance of an anonymous class that implements the interface without the need to define a named class.

```
interface Greeting {
    fun greet(name: String)
}

fun main() {
    val greetingObject = object : Greeting { //-> object expression
        override fun greet(name: String) {
            println("Hello, $name!")
        }
    }

    greetingObject.greet("Alice") // Output: Hello, Alice!
}

```
1. Anonymous Objects: You can create an object on-the-fly that implements an interface or inherits from a class without declaring a separate class.
2. Instantiation: You can provide implementations for any methods defined in the interface or class.
3. No Need for a Named Class: This is particularly useful when you need a one-off implementation and donâ€™t want to clutter your code with a full class definition.


## Object declaration
Object Declarations: Create singleton objects that can be used throughout the application.
```
object Singleton {
    fun sayHello() {
        println("Hello from Singleton!")
    }
}

// Usage
Singleton.sayHello() // Output: Hello from Singleton!
```
1. Global State Management
Singletons are often used to manage global state or configuration settings in an application. For instance, you might have a configuration object that holds settings that should be accessible **throughout** the app.
```
object AppConfig {
    var apiUrl: String = "https://api.example.com"
    var timeout: Int = 30
}

```
2. Logs
You can create a singleton for logging purposes, ensuring that all parts of your application log messages through a single instance.
```
object Logger {
    fun log(message: String) {
        println("Log: $message")
    }
}

```
3. Service Locator or Dependency Injection
Singletons can be used in service locators or simple dependency injection frameworks to provide instances of services throughout an application.
```
object ServiceLocator {
    val networkService: NetworkService by lazy { NetworkService() }
    val databaseService: DatabaseService by lazy { DatabaseService() }
}

```

4. Event Bus
In applications that require communication between different parts, a singleton event bus can facilitate this by allowing components to subscribe and publish events.
```
object EventBus {
    private val listeners = mutableListOf<(String) -> Unit>()

    fun subscribe(listener: (String) -> Unit) {
        listeners.add(listener)
    }

    fun publish(message: String) {
        listeners.forEach { it(message) }
    }
}

```

5. Caching
A singleton can also be used for caching data that needs to be accessed frequently across different parts of the application.
```
object DataCache {
    private val cache = mutableMapOf<String, Any>()

    fun put(key: String, value: Any) {
        cache[key] = value
    }

    fun get(key: String): Any? {
        return cache[key]
    }
}

```
6. Testing
In unit tests, you can use singletons to create mock or stub implementations of services that can be reused across different tests.
