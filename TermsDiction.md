## Difference between open() and abstarct()
Abstract: -> payment systems: differenct payment function has to override all same functions
Must Override: Any subclass of an abstract class must implement all abstract methods defined in that class. This enforces a contract, ensuring that specific behavior is provided by the subclass.
Cannot Be Instantiated: You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly.
Can Have Both Abstract and Concrete Methods: An abstract class can contain both methods without implementation (abstract methods) and methods with implementation (concrete methods).

Open: -> Optional override, not strict
